# Temporal Breakpoints for multiverse Debugging

This is the repositiory accompanying the article "Temporal Brakpoints for multiverse debugging".

This code will demo a command line version of our debugger, working with AnimUML as subject language to debug, and three different breakpoints languages to use, one based on regular expressions, the other two based on AnimUML automatas, but including or not the capability to express liveness properties through encoding of BÃ¼chi automatons.

## Installation
The debugger is presented as a node javascript application. 
After cloning the repository, change your directory to the root folder and run 

    npm install 

to install all necesary dependancies.

## Launch

To run the debugger, run 

    node main.js i 

with `i` the index as argument correponding to one of the proposed configurations found in samples/configuration.json. 

Once the debugger is running, three actions are available:

- `initial` or `i` to initialize the debugger
- `actions` or `a` to list the available actions
- `execute j` or `e j` to execute the chosen action, with `j` being the index of the action in the list returned by "actions".
